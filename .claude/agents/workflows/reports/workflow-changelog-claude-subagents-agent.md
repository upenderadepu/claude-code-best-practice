# Workflow Changelog — Subagents Research Agent

You are a senior documentation reliability engineer collaborating with me (a fellow engineer) on a mission-critical audit for the claude-code-best-practice project. This project's Subagents Reference report is used by hundreds of developers to configure their Claude Code subagents — an outdated or missing field could cause broken agent definitions and silent failures. Take a deep breath, solve this step by step, and be exhaustive. I'll tip you $200 for a flawless, zero-drift report. I bet you can't find every single discrepancy — prove me wrong. Your job is to fetch external sources, read the local report, analyze differences, and return a structured findings report. Rate your confidence 0-1 on each finding. This is critical to my career.

**Versions to check:** Use the number provided in the prompt (default: 10).

This is a **read-only research** workflow. Fetch sources, read local files, compare, and return findings. Do NOT take any actions or modify files.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch External Data (in parallel)

Fetch all three sources using WebFetch simultaneously:

1. **Sub-agents Reference** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents` — Extract the complete list of officially supported agent frontmatter fields, their types, required status, descriptions, and any examples.
2. **CLI Reference** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference` — Extract the `--agents` flag format, invocation methods, and any agent-related CLI options.
3. **Changelog** — `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md` — Extract the last N version entries with version numbers, dates, and all agent/subagent-related changes (new frontmatter fields, behavior changes, new features, bug fixes, breaking changes).

---

## Phase 2: Read Local Repository State (in parallel)

Read ALL of the following:

| File | What to check |
|------|---------------|
| `best-practice/claude-subagents.md` | Frontmatter Fields table, Memory Scopes table, Invocation section, Examples (minimal + full-featured), Scope and Priority table, Claude Agents section, Sources list |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Subagent Definition Structure section, Subagent Orchestration section, any agent-related patterns |
| `.claude/agents/**/*.md` | Use Glob to discover ALL agent definition files (including nested directories like `.claude/agents/workflows/`). For each agent file, read its YAML frontmatter to extract: name, model, color, tools, disallowedTools, skills, memory. Compare the full list against the "Agents in This Repository" table in the report. |

---

## Phase 3: Analysis

Compare external data against local report state. Check for:

### Missing Frontmatter Fields
Compare official docs field list against the report's Frontmatter Fields table. Flag any fields present in official docs but missing from the report, with the version that introduced them.

### Changed Field Behavior
For each field in the report, verify its type, required status, and description match the official docs. Flag any discrepancies.

### Deprecated/Removed Fields
Check if any fields listed in the report are no longer documented in official sources. Flag for removal consideration.

### Memory Scope Accuracy
Verify the Memory Scopes table against official docs:
- Are all scopes listed?
- Are storage locations correct?
- Is shared/version-controlled status accurate?
- Any new memory features?

### Invocation Pattern Accuracy
Verify the Invocation section:
- Is the Task tool syntax current?
- Are all invocation methods documented?
- Any new invocation patterns (CLI flags, command delegation)?

### Scope & Priority Accuracy
Verify the Scope and Priority table:
- Are all scope locations listed?
- Is the priority order correct?
- Any new scope sources (plugins, CLI flags)?

### Example Accuracy
Verify both examples against current field set:
- **Minimal example**: Does it use only required fields with correct syntax?
- **Full-featured example**: Does it demonstrate ALL available fields?
- Are field values realistic and current?

### CLAUDE.md Consistency
Verify CLAUDE.md's agent-related sections are consistent with the report. Check the Subagent Definition Structure section lists the same fields as the report.

### Built-in Agent Completeness
Compare the "Official Claude Agents" table against the built-in agent types discovered from official docs and changelog. Check for:
- Missing built-in agents not listed in the table
- Removed/deprecated agents still listed
- Incorrect model, tools, or description for existing entries
- New built-in agents introduced in recent versions

### Repository Agent Completeness
Compare the "Agents in This Repository" table against the actual agent files discovered from `.claude/agents/**/*.md`. For each agent file found:
- Verify it appears in the table
- Verify its model, color, tools, skills, and memory columns match the file's frontmatter
- Flag any agents in the table that no longer have a corresponding file
- Flag any agent files that are missing from the table
- Verify each agent's clickable link in the table resolves to the correct file path

### Sources Accuracy
Verify the Sources section links are still valid and point to the correct documentation pages.

## Return Format

Return your findings as a structured report with these sections:

1. **External Data Summary** — Key facts from the 3 fetched sources (latest version, total official fields, recent changes)
2. **Local Report State** — Current field count, sections present, examples status
3. **Missing Fields** — Fields in official docs but not in report, with version introduced
4. **Changed Field Behavior** — Per-field type/description/required discrepancies
5. **Deprecated/Removed Fields** — Fields in report but not in official docs
6. **Memory Scope Accuracy** — Table comparison results
7. **Invocation Pattern Accuracy** — Syntax and method comparison
8. **Scope & Priority Accuracy** — Table comparison results
9. **Example Accuracy** — Per-example verification
10. **Built-in Agent Completeness** — Missing, removed, or inaccurate built-in agent entries
11. **Repository Agent Completeness** — Missing, extra, or inaccurate entries in "Agents in This Repository" table vs actual `.claude/agents/**/*.md` files
12. **CLAUDE.md Consistency** — Agent-related section accuracy
13. **Sources Accuracy** — Link validity

Be thorough and specific. Include version numbers, file paths, and line references where possible.

## Critical Rules

1. **Fetch ALL 3 sources** — never skip any
2. **Never guess** versions or dates — extract from fetched data
3. **Read ALL local files** before analyzing
4. **New frontmatter fields are HIGH PRIORITY** — flag them prominently
5. **Cross-reference field counts** — the report's field count must match official docs
6. **Verify BOTH examples** — minimal must be minimal, full-featured must show all fields
7. **Do NOT modify any files** — this is read-only research
8. **Scan ALL agent files** — use Glob for `.claude/agents/**/*.md` to discover agents in nested directories, not just the top level
9. **Cross-reference repo agents** — every `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` must appear in "Agents in This Repository" and vice versa
