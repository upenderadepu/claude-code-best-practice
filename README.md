## CONCEPTS

> **Note:** Custom slash commands have been merged into skills. Files in `.claude/commands/` still work, but skills (`.claude/skills/`) are recommended as they support additional features like supporting files, invocation control, and subagent execution.

- **[Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)** - Reusable knowledge, workflows, and slash commands that Claude can load on-demand or you invoke with `/skill-name`
- **[Agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)** - Custom agents in `.claude/agents/` with their own name, color, tools, permissions, and model — usable as default main agent (`"agent"` in settings.json) or as isolated subagents via the Task tool
- **[Memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)** - Persistent context via CLAUDE.md files and `@path` imports that Claude sees every session
- **[Rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-clauderules)** - Modular topic-specific instructions in `.claude/rules/*.md` with optional path-scoping via frontmatter
- **[Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)** - Deterministic scripts that run outside the agentic loop on specific events
- **[MCP Servers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)** - Model Context Protocol connections to external tools, databases, and APIs
- **[Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)** - Distributable packages that bundle skills, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers
- **[Marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins)** - Host and discover plugin collections
- **[Sandboxing](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing)** - File and network isolation runtime that improves safety while reducing permission prompts
- **[Output Styles](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles)** - Configurable response tone and format — Explanatory, Learning, or Custom
- **[Settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)** - Hierarchical configuration system for Claude Code behavior (37 settings, 84 env vars)
- **[Permissions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/iam)** - Fine-grained access control for tools and operations with wildcard syntax

**Extension Overview:** See [Extend Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/features-overview) for when to use each feature and how they layer together.

## MY EXPERIENCE

■ **Workflows**
- Claude.md should not exceed 150+ lines. (still not 100% guaranteed)
- use commands for your workflows instead of agents
- have feature specific subagents (extra context) with skills (progressive disclosure) instead of general qa, backend engineer.
- /memory, /rules, constitution.md does not guarantee anything
- do manual /compact at max 50%
- always start with plan mode
- subtasks should be so small that it can be completed in less than 50% context
- vanilla cc is better than any workflows with smaller tasks
- commit often, as soon as task is completed, commit.

■ **Utilities**
- iTerm terminal instead of IDE (crash issue) 
- Wispr Flow for voice prompting (10x productivity)
- claude-code-voice-hooks for claude feedback
- status line for context awareness and fast compacting
- git worktrees for parallel development
- /permissions with wildcard syntax (`Bash(npm run *)`, `Edit(/docs/**)`) instead of dangerously-skip-permissions
- /sandbox to reduce permission prompts with file and network isolation
- output styles: use Explanatory when learning a new codebase, Learning for coaching
- /keybindings to remap any key, settings live reload

■ **Debugging** 
- /doctor
- always ask claude to run the terminal (you want to see logs of) as a background task for better debugging
- use mcp (claude in chrome, playwright, chrome dev tool) to let claude see chrome console logs on its own
- provide screenshots of the issue

## COMMAND + SKILL + SUBAGENT ARCHITECTURE

<p align="center">
  <img src="!/command-skill-agent-flow.svg" alt="Command Skill Agent Architecture Flow" width="600">
</p>

| Component | Role | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Command** | Entry point, user interaction | `/weather-orchestrator` |
| **Agent** | Orchestrates workflow with preloaded skills | `weather` agent |
| **Skills** | Domain knowledge injected at startup | `weather-fetcher`, `weather-transformer` |

**When to use:** Multi-step workflows • Domain-specific knowledge injection • Sequential tasks • Reusable components

**Why it works:** Progressive disclosure • Single execution context • Clean separation • Reusability

See [weather-orchestration-architecture](weather-orchestration/weather-orchestration-architecture.md) for implementation details.
