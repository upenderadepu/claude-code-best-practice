## CONCEPTS

| Feature | Location | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| [**Skills**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Reusable knowledge, workflows, and slash commands — load on-demand or invoke with `/skill-name` |
| [**Commands**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) | `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | Entry-point prompts for workflows — invoke with `/command-name` |
| [**Sub-Agents**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) | `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | [![Best Practice](!/tags/best-practice.svg)](best-practice/claude-subagents.md) [![Implemented](!/tags/implemented.svg)](implementation/claude-subagents-implementation.md) Custom agents with their own name, color, tools, permissions, and model — usable as main agent or isolated subagents via the Task tool |
| [**Memory**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory) | `CLAUDE.md` | Persistent context via CLAUDE.md files and `@path` imports that Claude sees every session |
| [**Rules**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-clauderules) | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Modular topic-specific instructions with optional path-scoping via frontmatter |
| [**Hooks**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) | `.claude/hooks/` | Deterministic scripts that run outside the agentic loop on specific events |
| [**MCP Servers**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) | `.claude/settings.json` | Model Context Protocol connections to external tools, databases, and APIs |
| [**Plugins**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) | distributable packages | Bundles of skills, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers |
| [**Marketplaces**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins) | plugin registries | Host and discover plugin collections |
| [**Sandboxing**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing) | runtime config | File and network isolation that improves safety while reducing permission prompts |
| [**Output Styles**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles) | `.claude/settings.json` | Configurable response tone and format — Explanatory, Learning, or Custom |
| [**Settings**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) | `.claude/settings.json` | Hierarchical configuration system for Claude Code behavior (37 settings, 84 env vars) |
| [**Permissions**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/iam) | `.claude/settings.json` | Fine-grained access control for tools and operations with wildcard syntax |

> **Note:** Custom slash commands have been merged into skills. Files in `.claude/commands/` still work, but skills (`.claude/skills/`) are recommended as they support additional features like supporting files, invocation control, and subagent execution.

## MY EXPERIENCE

■ **Workflows**
- Claude.md should not exceed 150+ lines. (still not 100% guaranteed)
- use commands for your workflows instead of agents
- have feature specific subagents (extra context) with skills (progressive disclosure) instead of general qa, backend engineer.
- /memory, /rules, constitution.md does not guarantee anything
- do manual /compact at max 50%
- always start with plan mode
- subtasks should be so small that it can be completed in less than 50% context
- vanilla cc is better than any workflows with smaller tasks
- commit often, as soon as task is completed, commit.

■ **Utilities**
- iTerm terminal instead of IDE (crash issue) 
- Wispr Flow for voice prompting (10x productivity)
- claude-code-voice-hooks for claude feedback
- status line for context awareness and fast compacting
- git worktrees for parallel development
- /permissions with wildcard syntax (`Bash(npm run *)`, `Edit(/docs/**)`) instead of dangerously-skip-permissions
- /sandbox to reduce permission prompts with file and network isolation
- output styles: use Explanatory when learning a new codebase, Learning for coaching
- /keybindings to remap any key, settings live reload

■ **Debugging** 
- /doctor
- always ask claude to run the terminal (you want to see logs of) as a background task for better debugging
- use mcp (claude in chrome, playwright, chrome dev tool) to let claude see chrome console logs on its own
- provide screenshots of the issue

## <img src="!/tags/orchestration-workflow-hd.svg" alt="Orchestration Workflow">

Multi-step workflows using the **Command → Agent → Skills** architecture pattern.

<p align="center">
  <img src="!/command-skill-agent-flow.svg" alt="Command Skill Agent Architecture Flow" width="600">
</p>

| Component | Role | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Command** | Entry point, user interaction | `/weather-orchestrator` |
| **Agent** | Orchestrates workflow with preloaded skills | `weather` agent |
| **Skills** | Domain knowledge injected at startup | `weather-fetcher`, `weather-transformer` |

**When to use:** Multi-step workflows • Domain-specific knowledge injection • Sequential tasks • Reusable components

**Why it works:** Progressive disclosure • Single execution context • Clean separation • Reusability

See [orchestration-workflow](orchestration-workflow/orchestration-workflow.md) for implementation details.
