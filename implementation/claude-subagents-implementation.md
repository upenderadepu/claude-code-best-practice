The weather agent is implemented in this repo as an example of the **Command → Agent → Skills** architecture pattern.

## Weather Agent

**File**: [`.claude/agents/weather.md`](../.claude/agents/weather.md)

```yaml

name: weather
description: Use this agent PROACTIVELY when you need to fetch and transform
  weather data for Karachi, Pakistan. This agent fetches real-time temperature
  from wttr.in API and applies transformation rules from
  weather-orchestration/input.md, writing results to
  weather-orchestration/output.md.

# Weather Agent

You are a specialized weather agent that fetches and transforms weather data
for Karachi, Pakistan.

## Your Task

Execute the weather workflow by following the instructions from your preloaded
skills sequentially:

1. **First**: Follow the `weather-fetcher` skill instructions to fetch the
   current temperature
2. **Then**: Follow the `weather-transformer` skill instructions to apply
   transformations and write results
3. **Finally**: Update your agent memory with the reading details for
   historical tracking

...
```

The agent has two skills preloaded (`weather-fetcher` and `weather-transformer`) that provide step-by-step instructions for fetching from the wttr.in API and applying transformation rules.

---

## How to Use

```bash
$ claude
> What is the weather in Karachi?
```

The weather agent is the **Agent** in the Command → Agent → Skills orchestration pattern. It receives the workflow from the `/weather-orchestrator` command and executes it using two preloaded skills (`weather-fetcher`, `weather-transformer`) within a single execution context.
